  The term quantamental is, in fact, a portmanteau of _quantitative_ and _fundamental_ and thus refers to an investment strategy that combines both approaches to investing, with the aim of improving returns. By merging these two approaches to investing---computer power with human insight---it is believed that one can extract superior insights from financial data, and hence, get better investment results.
  
  Recent developments in Data Science and Finance have proved that the use data in finance has never been more important. Of course the use of data and modern modeling techniques (say, Machine Learning or Deep Learning) is ubiquitous and is not only applicable to finance, but I've always been more interested in how data can help make better, smarter investment decisions. I hope you are intrigued, too. If not, read it from Larry Fink himself:

  "_The democratization of information has made it much harder for active management._" ---Larry Fink.
  
  Below you can find some featured blogposts from which I hope you can learn some quant finance.
