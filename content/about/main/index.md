  The term quantamental is, in fact, a portmanteau of quantitative and fundamental and thus refers to an investment strategy that involves combining quantitative and fundamental approaches to investing, with the aim of improving returns. 
  
  By merging these two approaches to investing---computer power with human insight---it is hoped by those now adopting quantamental investing that such an approach can deliver superior returns. Indeed, this combination is often regarded as a melding of man and machine: the investor harnesses the scale and power of data and blends it with the benefits of human insight in order to unearth winning investment strategies.
  
  Below you can find some featured blogposts which I hope can teach you something.
