There's a reason why you're here reading this blog right now. You and I are not so different, we have something in common. You and I both think that the use data (and Data Science) has a place, a very important one, in finance. Of course the use of data and modern modeling techniques (say, Machine Learning or Deep Learning, or what have you) is ubiquitous and is not only applicable to finance, but I've always been more interested in how data can help make better, smarter investment decisions. As Larry Fink himself has said:

"The democratization of information has made it much harder for active management," Larry Fink. :us: 

It's worth noting that **Data Science is not equal to modeling**, and it is also not exclusive to modeling. Data Science is **a way of working, it's a way of thinking** and my purpose in creating this blog is to think about finance, and hopefully, through that process, share something of value to you.
