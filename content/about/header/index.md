Thanks for stopping by!

I'm a M.Sc. in Data Science and B.Sc. in Finance working a full-time job as a Senior Data Scientist at GBM. My research interests include applications of data science processes and machine learning in finance. I work in the Data Science & Strategy team and develop novel data mining methods to extract actionable investment ideas.

The purpose of creating this blog is to share my learning process and hopefully, through that process, share something of value to you.
